# Individual Contacts

## Create a New Contact

1. Click the plus \(![](../.gitbook/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
2. Specify the contact is an **Individual**.
3. The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for **Individual Contacts:**_

* **Individual Name** \(Required\): Enter individual's full name If you are entering a generic Individual contact, you can enter a Position Name without entering an Individual Name. For example: you could enter GCP LCC Data Manager as a Position Name rather than an Individual Name.
* **Position Name** \(Required\): Enter individual's full title; avoid acronyms If you have entered the individual's name, Position Name is not required \(one or the other is required, but not both\).
* **Contact Type** \(Required\): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make sure every contact has Contact Type selected - this is essential for the Science Catalog funding summaries.
* **Member Organization** \(Required\): Select organization\(s\). You can make an individual part of multiple organizations.
* **Email Address** \(Required\): Enter individual's email
* **Physical Address** \(Best Practice\): Enter a physical address
* **Logo** \(Optional\):
  * It is uncommon that you would add a logo for an individual. If the individual is part of an organization, the individual will inherit the logo from the organization.
  * You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise you will get an error on the metadata records that include that contact.
{% endhint %}
