# Summary Contact Requirements

The following compiles all of the required and recommended contact information for LCC project and product metadata. This information is also listed in the specific metadata sections in the manual.

## Locations for Contact Information

Once your contacts have been created in mdEditor, there are five places in a metadata record where you should add contacts.

_Please see the corresponding sections for which contacts should be added where._ 

1. [Main Tab](../project-entry-guidance/record-main-copy.md#point-of-contacts) / "Point of Contact” section 
2. [Main Tab](../project-entry-guidance/record-main-copy.md#responsible-parties-required) / Citation / “Responsible Parties” section 
3. [Metadata Tab](../project-entry-guidance/metadata-tab.md#metadata-contacts) / “Contacts” section 
4. [Funding Tab](../project-entry-guidance/funding-tab.md) / “Allocation”  section. For Projects only.
5. [Distribution Tab](../product-entry-guidance/distribution.md) / "Contacts” section. For Products only.

### **Main / Point of Contact**

| Role | Contact | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| pointOfContact | LCC Network Data Steward | Required |
| pointOfContact | Your LCC | NOT Required \(\*see below\) |
| principalInvestigator | The Project PI | Best Practice |

\*Note: Given the transition away from LCCs, it is no longer required to add the LCC as a Main / Point of Contact in new or updated metadata records. The LCC Network Data Steward will serve as a long-term backup point of contact.

### **Main / Citation / Responsible Parties**

This must include a point of contact, but may also include other responsible parties such as funders \(including your LCC\), partners, collaborators, and contributors. Collaborators could be intellectual participants while contributors could be intellectual and financial participants.

| Role | Contact | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| pointofContact | LCC Network Data Steward | Required |
| administrator | Your LCC | Required |
| principalInvestigator | The Project PI | Best Practice |

### **Metadata / Contacts**

| Role | Contact | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| author | See notes below | At least one is required |
| publisher | In most cases, this will be the LCC | Best Practice |
| pointOfContact | LCC Network Data Steward | Required |

**Regarding Role of "author"**

* The author does not necessarily have to be the LCC \(e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the original author\).
* "Author" can be an individual or an organization.
* You can enter your LCC data manager as the “author”. If you prefer, you can use a generic data manager contact rather than an individual name.
* At least one contact with the role of “author” is required. Does not necessarily have to be the LCC \(e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the original author\).

### **Funding / Allocation \(for Projects only\)**

#### Source \(Required\)

Add the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For LCC projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation. LCCs should be added as the funding "administrator" in the Other Contacts field.

{% hint style="info" %}
Funding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source \(and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.\). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field \(and choose the role of "administrator"\).
{% endhint %}

#### Recipient \(Required\)

Add the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as separate allocations.

You could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as "principalInvestigator."

#### Other Contacts \(\*New Required Metadata Improvement\)

Add the LCC as the funding "administrator" for all LCC allocations. The funding source should identify the agency who supplied the funding.

{% hint style="info" %}
Funding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator could include "Ecological Services" or a specific field office.
{% endhint %}

### **Distribution \(for Products only\)**

* Add the relevant contact for “distributor” of the product \(if you fill out anything in the Distribution section, a contact for Distributor is required\).
