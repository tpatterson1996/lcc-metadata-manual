# Sub-Project Protocol

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

1. An LCC funds a distinct portion or sub-project of a project or a distinct product of another LCCâ€™s project; or
2. An LCC funds a distinct portion of a CASC project.

In this case, the funding information should only be entered in a project metadata record once. If the funding for a sub-project is distributed separately, then it can be included in sub-project metadata. Otherwise, if the sub-project was funded from a parent project and the funding allocation is not distinctly identified, then all the funding information should be included in the parent project metadata held by an LCC. A single funding allocation should NOT be duplicated in multiple metadata records.
