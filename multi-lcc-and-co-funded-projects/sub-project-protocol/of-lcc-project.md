# Sub-project of LCC Project

When your project is a sub-project underneath an LCC project, complete the following requirements for the sub-project in addition to the standard metadata requirements. Products of a sub-project can be entered as normal \(i.e., treat the sub-project as a normal project for the purposes of the product metadata and associations\).

## Main/Points of Contact

Add the collaborating LCC\(s\) as a “collaborator” in the metadata for the LCCs that participate.

## Main/Citation/Responsible Parties

Add the collaborating LCC\(s\) as a “collaborator” in the metadata for the LCCs that participate.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the LCC funding the sub-project or distinct product is the “administrator” in the sub-project metadata and should be included as such according to standard metadata contact requirements.
{% endhint %}

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Include the lead LCC as “publisher.”

Collaborating LCCs do not need to be listed here. For sub-projects, there could be different lead LCCs between a sub-project and its parent project. Within a specific sub-project, the lead LCC and publisher in Metadata Contacts should be the same.

## Associated

Associate the relevant projects, sub-projects, and products with each other in mdEditor under Associated. Your ownership/edit access to the related items will determine how you enter the associations in mdEditor. All information below refers to the Associated tab.

### When you have edit rights to Parent Project

If your sub-project falls underneath a project that you also manage, you can create the association by defining the association type and linking your records as normal \(no further information needed\).

In the Associated tab, add the association type as one of the following and select the appropriate record to link:

* As parent project to sub-project relationship: “parentProject”/”subProject” or vice versa
* As parent project to product relationship: “parentProject”/“product”
* If neither is a parent of the other, as Part of the other project: “isPartOf”/“isPartOf”

### When you do NOT have edit rights to Parent Project

If your sub-project falls underneath an LCC project to which you do not have edit rights for its ScienceBase record or mdEditor file, you must associate the item manually within mdEditor.

Enter the association type as described above, enter the resource type, plus copy and paste the title and ScienceBase Identifier for the associated item \(see Figure 1\).

If you are creating associations to other LCC items that have the Science Catalog tag, then those items will show up in the Science Catalog, as will your sub-projects and products.

If your sub-project falls underneath a CASC project, follow that [protocol](of-casc-project.md).
