# CASC Responsibilities

The CASCs will complete the following metadata responsibilities for the CASC records for co-funded projects and products, after being notified that an LCC has created associations to the CASC ScienceBase records.

## Co-funded Protocol

### When a CASC project is co-funded with an LCC:

Add the following statement to the Summary in the CASC ScienceBase record:

* “This project was co-funded by the \[X, Y, Z\] Climate Adaptation Science Centers and the \[A, B, C\] Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. An alternate reference to this project can be found here\[insert LCC ScienceBase URL\].”

Example: “This project was co-funded by the South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center and the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative. An alternate reference to this project can be found [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a78be62e4b00f54eb1e849c).”

The LCC will include a parallel statement in the Summary field for their ScienceBase record, link back to the CASC record, and create the association in ScienceBase.

### When a CASC product is co-funded with an LCC:

Add the following text to the Summary in the CASC ScienceBase record:

“This product was co-funded by the \[A, B, C\] Landscape Conservation Cooperatives and the \[X, Y, Z\] Climate Adaptation Science Centers. An alternate reference to this product can be found here\[insert CASC ScienceBase URL\].”

Example: “This project was co-funded by the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center. An alternate reference to this product can be found [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a78be62e4b00f54eb1e849c).”

The LCC will include a parallel statement in the Summary field for their ScienceBase record, link back to the CASC record, and create the association in ScienceBase.

## Sub-Project Protocol

### If a CASC project is a sub-project of an LCC project:

1. Add the following text to the Summary in the CASC ScienceBase record: “This project is a sub-project of the \[X\] Landscape Conservation Cooperative project described here\[insert LCC ScienceBase URL\].”
2. Add the association in ScienceBase as a “subprojectOf” the LCC record.
