# for Multi-LCC Projects

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

* One or more LCCs co-funds a project with one or more LCCs and there are not distinct sub-projects that can be attributed to either LCC separately.

## Metadata Responsibility

The lead LCC data manager is responsible for project and product metadata. There should only be one metadata record for each multi-LCC project and product. These records will show up and be searchable in the Science Catalog for each collaborating LCC identified in the metadata.

In addition to standard metadata requirements, enter the following for the multi-LCC project and product records:

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the name of all funding LCCs as a “collaborator.”

Here, UMGL LCC led the project with funding support from ETPBR LCC._

## Main/Citation/Responsible Parties

Add the name of all funding LCCs as a “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %}
The lead LCC should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added again as a “collaborator.”
{% endhint %}

## Main/Abstract

Add the following text as as the last sentence:

"This \[project/product\] was co-funded by multiple Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A LCC, B LCC, and C LCC.”

* Example: This project was co-funded by multiple Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC and the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers LCC.
* Example: This product was co-funded by multiple Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: Great Northern LCC, Great Basin LCC, and Southern Rockies LCC.

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Include the lead LCC as “publisher.”

Collaborating LCCs do not need to be listed here.

## Funding \(for Projects only\)

Add a separate funding allocation for each year and each LCC that provided funding.

1. The source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \(or other agency that provided LCC project funding such as Bureau of Reclamation\)
2. Add the funding LCC as the “administrator” in the Other Contacts section \(see Figure 2 and 3\).
