# Collaborating Protocol

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

* Multiple LCCs collaborate on a single project where only one LCC provided funding \(the funding LCC is the lead LCC\). There can only be one lead LCC per project.

## Metadata Responsibility

The lead LCC data manager is responsible for project and product metadata. There should only be one metadata record for each collaborating project and product. These records will show up and be searchable in the Science Catalog for each collaborating LCC identified in the metadata.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the project is collaborative between multiple LCCs but does not involve any funding allocations, the relevant LCCs should determine who will be the lead LCC and be responsible for entering the metadata.
{% endhint %}

In addition to standard metadata requirements, enter the following for projects with multiple LCC collaborators:

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the collaborating LCC\(s\) as a “collaborator.”

## Main/Citation/Responsible Parties

Add the collaborating LCC\(s\) as a “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %}
The lead LCC should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added again as a “collaborator.”
{% endhint %}

Here, UMGL LCC led the project with funding support from ETPBR LCC._

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Include the lead LCC in Metadata Contacts \(choosing the appropriate role - see [Metadata Tab: Project](../project-entry-guidance/metadata-tab.md) for more info\).

Collaborating LCCs do not need to be listed here.
