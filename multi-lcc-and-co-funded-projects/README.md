# Multi-LCC and Co-funded Projects

This describes the additional metadata entry requirements for documenting projects and products that involve multiple LCCs or were co-funded with the Climate Adaptation Science Centers \(CASCs\). All other LCC metadata requirements and best practices still apply, unless otherwise noted.

## Goals

The goals for these guidelines are:

1. to maintain consistent, quality metadata records for projects and products across all LCCs for inclusion in the LCC Network Science Catalog;
2. to avoid duplicate reporting of the same funding, while also allowing each LCC to fully describe how it provided funds or otherwise supported a project;
3. to avoid the appearance of duplicated research between LCCs and CASCs; and
4. to clearly communicate the relationships between LCC and CASC funded projects to the public.

## Terms

**Multi-LCC** refers to a single project or product that is supported by more than one LCC. Support may come in the form of collaboration, in-kind donations of effort, and/or from funding allocations.

**Multi-LCC co-funded** refers to a single project that is financially supported by more than one LCC.

**Lead LCC** refers to the LCC that is instrumental in initializing and administering a project. There can be only one lead LCC per project.

**CASC co-funded** refers to a single project or product that is supported by one or more LCCs and one or more USGS Climate Adaptation Science Centers \(CASCs\).

**Matching** refers to funds or in-kind donations of effort that are provided by organizations outside of LCCs.

**Project** is a particular effort in a particular geography with specific outcomes.

**Sub-project** is an effort that is related to a project, but is distinctly different in some specific aspect, such as geography, goal, or product. A sub-project often expands the scope of a project or grows from a research need identified by the parent project. If two LCCs fund similar work in different geographical regions, or for different species, then these are considered to be separate projects with separate deliverables, even if both are part of a larger effort.

## Scenario Descriptions

**Collaborating Project**: One LCC leads a project with joint support or cooperation in the form of advisory consultation or staff time from another LCC. The collaborating LCC may or may not provide funding support.

**Sub-Project** or Project Continuation: One LCC \(LCC A\) is the lead LCC for a large project, while another LCC \(LCC B\), funds a distinct sub-project or distinct deliverable of the overarching project and likewise for LCC/CASC projects.

**Multi-LCC Co-funded Project**: One LCC leads a project with funding support from another LCC\(s\). The project cannot be divided into distinct sub-projects.

**LCC/CASC Co-funded Project**: LCC\(s\) and CASC\(s\) co-fund a project without distinct sub-projects.
